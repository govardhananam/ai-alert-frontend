                                    AI-Powered Alert Management System

Description of the Product / Problem Solved

The AI-Powered Alert Management System is an intelligent event monitoring and response system designed to:
	•	Analyze incoming system alerts in real-time.
	•	Categorize and predict the severity of alerts using an AI model.
	•	Automate incident response and escalation based on severity.
	•	Provide an interactive dashboard for users to view and manage alerts.
	•	Minimize manual intervention and improve incident resolution time.

Use Cases
	•	IT Infrastructure Monitoring: Detects system errors and escalates critical failures.
	•	Security Incident Response: Flags suspicious activity for security teams.
	•	IoT Monitoring: Identifies and categorizes alerts from IoT devices.
	•	Cloud Service Monitoring: Monitors multi-cloud environments for performance and uptime issues.

2. High-Level Functional Design & Architecture

System Components
	1.	FastAPI Backend (Python)
	•	Accepts alerts via an API (/receive_alert/).
	•	Uses an AI model to predict alert severity.
	•	Stores alerts in an SQLite/PostgreSQL database.
	•	Exposes an API (/alerts/) to retrieve past alerts.
	2.	AI Model
	•	Uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to classify alert messages.
	•	Trained on historical alert data to predict Critical, Warning, or Info.
	•	Can be extended with machine learning models like scikit-learn or transformers.
	3.	React Frontend
	•	Allows users to submit alerts and view past incidents.
	•	Displays severity-based color-coded alerts.
	•	Provides an interactive dashboard.
	4.	Database (SQLite/PostgreSQL)
	•	Stores alerts with timestamps, severity, and status.
	•	Provides structured data retrieval for analysis.
	5.	Automated Actions (Incident Response)
	•	Critical Alerts → Restart services or notify engineers.
	•	Warning Alerts → Send email notifications.
	•	Info Alerts → Log the event for future reference.

3. Scale and Complexity of the Solution

Scalability
    •	Can handle real-time alerts using an event-driven architecture.
    •	Supports multi-cloud deployment (AWS, Azure, GCP).
    •	Can be extended to Kafka, AWS Lambda, or serverless processing.
    •	Supports PostgreSQL for high-volume data storage.

Complexity
	•	Uses machine learning-based severity prediction (NLP model).
	•	Supports automated actions to reduce manual workload.
	•	Can be integrated with logging & monitoring tools like Datadog, Prometheus.
